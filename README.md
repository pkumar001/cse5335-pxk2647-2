- What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

> I found most of the aspects of the implementation fairly easy to understand. The multiple AJAX calls is easy with the use of setInterval function. Using for loop with setTimeout function did not work as the loop ends before the timer of the setTimeout function ends.

- What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

> I found the implementation of animation of the new tuples added to the table particularly difficult. The time it takes to add a new row seemed too less to add any significant animation to the addition. Finally, I settled for the simplest of animations, fading the row in.

- If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?

> If I were to use these technologies professionally, my biggest concern would be getting stagnant with these technologies and not keeping myself updated with the new technologies in the field.
